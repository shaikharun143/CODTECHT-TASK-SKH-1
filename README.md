Task List Display: All tasks are displayed in a list format, with options to delete or mark them as completed.
Task Completion: Users can click on a task to mark it as completed, visually distinguishing it from pending tasks.
Task Deletion: Users can remove tasks from the list once they are no longer needed.
Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring usability across different devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
